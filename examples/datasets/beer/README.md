# Beer: NIR Spectra

The beer dataset contains 60 samples published by Norgaard et al. Recorded with a 30mm quartz cell on the undiluted degassed beer and measured from 1100 to 2250 nm (576 data points) in steps of 2 nm.

Variable tracked is "extract concentration", which is a quality parameter in the brewing industry, indicating the substrate potential for the yeast to ferment, giving rise to higher alcoholic content.

The original paper reports 60 different samples, but 80 samples are available in the dataset. Some data are possibly coming from duplicate experiments.
